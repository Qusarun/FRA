# FRA (Fair Roll Algorithm)
FRA is an algorithm designed to make luck-based things more consistent. For example, a 10% chance is almost always going to output "true" 1 out of 10 times. According to the few tests that I've done, it's more "fair" than using the standard C library 100% of the time (except for 45%-55% chances, where it's actually closer to 50% of the time). Note: you need to make separate instances of the algorithm for different percentages. So, for example, an instance that's already been used with a 50% chance is most likely going to be **less** fair when used on with a 30% chance.
